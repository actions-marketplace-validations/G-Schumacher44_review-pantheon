"""tests/test_security_md_denied_commands.py — SECURITY.md's prose list vs. the live source.

SECURITY.md's "Built-in read commands denied under `readonly`" section hand-restates, in prose, the
same 15 command names that live as code in ``pantheon.execution.DENIED_BUILTIN_BASH_COMMANDS`` —
docs need to stay readable prose, so the enumeration itself is not derived at doc-render time, but
nothing PREVIOUSLY asserted the two stayed in sync (issue #78's third instance of the same drift
class as ``tests/check_action_expressions.py``'s ``check_env_bindings`` and
``tests/test-execution-tier-python.sh``'s deny-list loop). A contributor who adds or removes an
entry from the code list without updating the doc — or vice versa — now fails this test instead of
shipping a doc that silently drifts from the behavior it describes.

Checked in BOTH directions: a name in the code but missing from the doc (an addition nobody
documented) and a name in the doc but absent from the code (a doc that overclaims what's actually
denied) are equally a drift, so both fail.
