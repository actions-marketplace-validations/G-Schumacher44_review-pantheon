# install.sh — idempotent installer for review-pantheon into a target repo.
#
# Usage: install.sh /abs/path/to/target-repo [--claude] [--cursor] [--codex] [--gemini]
#
# With no flags: gate-only install — copies the review personas and the REVIEW_RULES.md
# house-rules template into the target repo, and GENERATES a thin-caller
# `.github/workflows/review.yml` that calls this repo's own published composite action
# (`uses: G-Schumacher44/review-pantheon@<pinned-SHA>` — see generate_way_a_workflow below for
# the pin and how to re-pin it). The composite action reads its own gate logic (personas, the
# verdict decider, the read-only git wrapper) from ITS OWN checkout at run time
# (`github.action_path`), not from anything vendored into the target repo — collapsed from a
# second, hand-synced ~1,000-line reimplementation that used to live at action/review.yml (see
# DESIGN.md's "Published action" section and issue #36). The personas copied here exist so a
# target repo can maintain its own fork and point the generated workflow's commented-out
# `personas_path:` input at it; REVIEW_RULES.md is the one file the gate reads FROM the target
# repo by design (DESIGN.md's "House rules are pluggable"). Never overwrites a file that's been
# customized: a file that differs from the shipped version is left alone and reported as skipped.
#
# Does NOT install gate.conf — that file only matters to the CLI lane, and copying it into
# every repo by default meant most installs got a config file they never look at. CLI-lane
# users copy gate.conf.example themselves (docs/CLI.md documents this under gate.conf).
#
# --claude / --cursor / --codex / --gemini (combinable): install the counsel agents (and, for
# Claude, all five personas) as in-editor/in-CLI commands so they're usable interactively during
# planning and design, not just from the CI gate. agents/*.md stays the single canonical source
# (DESIGN.md rule 4) — every file these flags write is GENERATED from it at install time, never
# a hand-maintained duplicate. See DESIGN.md's "Provider lanes" and "Generated per-tool
# projections" sections for the design.
#
# --claude additionally installs the four canonical skills (skills/{gate,counsel,spec-driven,
# design-contract}/SKILL.md — the single hand-maintained source, same shape as agents/*.md under
# rule 4) verbatim into .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md, plus a generated /gate command
# (.claude/commands/gate.md, alongside the existing /counsel) that thin-invokes the gate skill.
# Claude-Code-only: no other tool flag touches skills/.
#
# --user (combined with one or more of the above): installs the SAME generated projections at
# USER level ($HOME) instead of into a target repo, so the personas follow you across every
# project instead of being installed per-repo. No target-repo argument is accepted with --user —
# it always writes under $HOME. The gate files (workflow, the vendored pantheon package,
# REVIEW_RULES) are NOT installed under --user: they're repo concepts (a PR gate belongs to one
# repo's CI), so
# --user installs only the per-tool agent/command projections, and requires at least one tool
# flag. Each tool's user-level destination is the same relative path as its repo-level one, just
# rooted at $HOME instead of the target repo — verified per tool against current official docs
# (see each generator's comment block below for the source).

  (no flags)   Gate-only install: personas + verdict script + GitHub Action (default, unchanged).
  --claude     Also install personas as Claude Code subagents, the four canonical skills
               (.claude/skills/{gate,counsel,spec-driven,design-contract}/), + /counsel and

  --codex      Also generate Codex Skills, .agents/skills/*/SKILL.md (best-effort — see DESIGN.md).
  --gemini     Also generate Gemini CLI commands, .gemini/commands/*.toml (best-effort — see DESIGN.md).
  --user       Install the per-tool agent projections at USER level ($HOME) instead of into a
               target repo — no target-repo argument, requires at least one of the flags above,
               and does NOT install the gate files (those are repo concepts).

# /gate — run the review-pantheon gate

PR reference / flags: $ARGUMENTS

Follow the procedure in the installed `gate` skill (`.claude/skills/gate/SKILL.md`) — dry-run
first, reading the combined verdict correctly, follow-up mode, and the findings discipline — to
run `pantheon gate` against the PR referenced above (ask which PR if none was given). Default to
a `--dry-run` pass first unless the arguments explicitly request a live run.

`/gate` installs the *procedure*, not the CLI itself — `install.sh --claude` never puts
`pantheon` on `PATH`. Before running it, check `command -v pantheon`. If that fails, check for
an existing `bootstrap.sh --prefix` install FIRST (default: `~/.review-pantheon/venv/bin/pantheon`;
a custom `--prefix <dir>` lands at `<dir>/venv/bin/pantheon` — ask the user where they pointed it
rather than assuming absence — use that path directly, or persist its printed `export PATH=...`
line) before installing a second copy; only if it's genuinely absent, install it
(`pipx install review-pantheon` — run `pipx ensurepath` if it installs but stays off `PATH` —,
`brew install g-schumacher44/tap/review-pantheon`, or `pip install -e .` from a checkout) — the
skill's "Locating `pantheon`" note has the full ordered rundown.

# /counsel — the review-pantheon counsel tier

Reference under review: $ARGUMENTS

Run the counsel agents installed at `.claude/agents/{socrates,diogenes,plato}.md` against the
reference above:

1. **If the decision is still open** — no committed design yet, or the approach itself is in
   question — invoke @socrates first to map the genuinely distinct options and give a go/no-go
   before anything narrower runs. Wait for its verdict before continuing.
2. **Once there is a proposed shape** — a design, spec, or diff to weigh in on — invoke
   @diogenes and @plato (either order, or together) against that shape. Diogenes asks whether
   it's more than the job needs; Plato asks whether it has a coherent shape or is drifting.
3. Skip socrates only when the request makes clear the approach is already decided and just the
   shape is under review — in that case run diogenes + plato only.

Each subagent ends its output with the standard JSON verdict object (agent, verdict,
has_blocker, findings, summary — see review-pantheon's DESIGN.md verdict contract). After every
invoked agent has reported:

- Show each agent's verdict and top findings.
- Surface disagreement plainly: if any agent reports a red verdict (`NO_GO`, `GUT`, `FRACTURED`)
  or `has_blocker: true`, lead with that — don't bury a blocker under a summary that reads as
  approval.
- End with one combined recommendation: proceed, proceed with the named guardrails, or stop and
  resolve the blocker(s) first.

review-pantheon installed into $TARGET

Post-install checklist:
  1. Set the repo secret CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN (Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions).
     Mint one with: claude setup-token (interactive, requires a Claude Code subscription) --
     then store it with: gh secret set CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN.
  2. Set the repo variable REVIEW_GATE_ENABLED=true (Settings -> Secrets and variables ->
     Actions -> Variables) — the workflow no-ops until this is set.
  3. .github/workflows/review.yml calls G-Schumacher44/review-pantheon@$WAY_A_PIN_SHA
     ($WAY_A_PIN_RELEASE) — confirm that pin still points at a release you trust
     (gh api repos/G-Schumacher44/review-pantheon/git/ref/tags/$WAY_A_PIN_RELEASE — the
     release's own tag, not the moving v1 — or check
     github.com/G-Schumacher44/review-pantheon/releases) before relying on this gate. The
     anthropics/claude-code-action pin that release itself uses lives inside its own
     action.yml, not in anything this script generated — re-pinning review-pantheon picks up
     whatever claude-code-action pin that release shipped with.
  4. Open a test PR with a deliberately planted blocker (a secret in a diff, an unguarded
     rm, whatever your REVIEW_RULES.md forbids) and confirm the gate goes RED before you
     trust a green result on a real PR.
  5. Only after step 4 passes, consider adding this workflow as a required status check.
  6. Using the CLI lane too? Copy gate.conf.example to gate.conf at your repo root and edit
     it — it isn't installed automatically (see docs/CLI.md's gate.conf section).

Prefer a moving tag over a pinned SHA you re-pin by hand? Skip install.sh's gate files
entirely and use examples/review-gate.yml instead — see docs/SETUP.md's "Way C — published
action."
