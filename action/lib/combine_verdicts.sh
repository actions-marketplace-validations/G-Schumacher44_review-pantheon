#!/usr/bin/env bash
# action/lib/combine_verdicts.sh — builds and (optionally) posts review-pantheon's ONE combined
# PR comment for the composite action (action.yml), and reports the overall gate color so the
# action's final "Enforce gate result" step can fail loud on red/unverified.
#
# The comment itself (headline + verdict table + human-first findings fold + machine-readable
# JSON tail) is built by `pantheon.render`, invoked below via a path relative to this file — safe
# because the published action ships this whole repo at github.action_path, unlike
# bootstrap.sh's CLI-only install footprint (which never touches action/). `pantheon.render` is
# the one renderer implementation every lane calls — this file's job is just to normalize this
# job's per-agent step outputs (env vars, see below) into its `<NAME>_*` env-var contract and
# call it. The vendored action/review.yml used to be a second render path that couldn't invoke
# it directly (a target repo never got a copy of pantheon/ except as a base-pinned $RUNNER_TEMP
# read, so it stayed a hand-synced inline copy) — issue #36 deleted that surface, leaving this
# script as the only place that assembles the comment for an Action-lane run.
#
# Usage: combine_verdicts.sh <space-separated agent list, e.g. "artemis apollo">
#
# Per agent NAME (upper-cased for the env var lookup), reads:
#   <NAME>_COLOR, <NAME>_VERDICT, <NAME>_TOP, <NAME>_FINDINGS, <NAME>_INVARIANT, <NAME>_REASON
#   — the matching decide-<agent> step's outputs (color / verdict / top_finding /
#   findings_json / invariant_fired / reason — see pantheon/verdict.py's emit_github_output).
#   An agent whose <NAME>_COLOR is empty is treated as "did not run" ->
#   unverified, same fail-closed rule as everywhere else in this repo.
# Also reads from env:
#   PR_NUMBER        - the PR to comment on (skips posting, with a warning, if unset — the
#                       shape a workflow_dispatch counsel run always takes, since there is no PR).
#                       When unset, the rendered comment is ALSO appended to $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
#                       (issue #102) — the job log alone left the "job log/step summary" promise
#                       in DESIGN.md's "counsel mode" section false.
#   GH_TOKEN          - passed through to `gh pr comment`
#   HEAD_SHA          - the reviewed PR head SHA, shown (short) in each agent's identity line
#   POST_COMMENT      - "true"/"false"; "false" computes the result and prints it but posts
#                       nothing (the action's own exit status still reflects the gate result
#                       either way, via GITHUB_OUTPUT's overall_color below)
#   APOLLO_DOCS_SKIPPED - "true"/"false"; synthesizes apollo's docs-only SKIPPED result since
#                       there's no separate artifact-writing step in this flow to do it in
#   MODE              - "gate" (default, if unset) or "counsel" (issue #95). Counsel mode
#                       prepends an "advisory, not a gate" banner to `pantheon_render_comment`'s
#                       own output before it's posted/printed — no new review logic, the SAME
#                       renderer every lane calls, just framed for a lane that cannot block a
#                       merge. Gate mode's own comment shape is completely unaffected: the banner
#                       block below only ever executes when MODE is literally "counsel".
# Writes: $GITHUB_OUTPUT's overall_color (green|yellow|red|unverified) — for counsel mode this is
# purely informational (see action.yml's "Counsel result" step, which never fails on it).
