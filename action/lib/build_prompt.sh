# action/lib/build_prompt.sh — shared prompt-builder for the composite action (action.yml).
#
# action.yml can't loop `uses:` steps at runtime (composite-action steps are a static YAML
# list, not a template body — see action.yml's own header comment for the doc-verified
# reasoning), so the five possible agents each get their own literal build/run/decide step
# trio. This script is what keeps that unrolling from becoming five hand-copied prompt-builder
# bodies: one file, invoked once per enabled agent, same fence-stripping + context-block shape
# the vendored action/review.yml's own inline "Build prompt" step used before issue #36 deleted
# it (kept identical on purpose while both existed — so a persona saw the same context
# regardless of which surface invoked it; this is now the only surface).
#
# Usage: build_prompt.sh <agent-name> <personas-dir> <prompt-out-file>
# Reads from env: REPO_NAME, PR_NUMBER, PR_TITLE, BASE_SHA, HEAD_SHA, BASE_REF, RULES_FILE,
# RULES_PRESENT (true/false), RULES_CONTENT_PATH, and — apollo only — SPEC_FILE, SPEC_PRESENT
# (true/false), SPEC_CONTENT_PATH. The non-apollo build-prompt steps in action.yml don't set
# SPEC_FILE/SPEC_PRESENT/SPEC_CONTENT_PATH at all, so all three default to empty/false below
# rather than tripping `set -u`.
#
# RULES_CONTENT_PATH/SPEC_CONTENT_PATH are PATHS to already-fetched file content (under
# $RUNNER_TEMP), resolved ONCE by action.yml's "Resolve gate configuration" step via
# `git show <base-sha>:<path>` against the PR's BASE commit — never read from disk here directly,
# and never from the checked-out working tree, which on a fork PR is attacker-controlled head
# content (DESIGN.md's "Security posture" — "Base-SHA-pinned context file reads"). Content
# travels as a file path, not the content itself, because a large base spec/rules file blew past
# the OS's per-step environment size limit when it rode along as a plain env var — a file has no
# such ceiling. This script only cats what it's handed; it has no filesystem access to
# REVIEW_RULES.md/DESIGN.md of its own, by design — there's structurally no path here for head
# content to reach the prompt.
