"""pantheon.render — the combined-PR-comment renderer.

Ports the retired bash CLI's ``render_comment.sh`` (removed in #29) — the ONE bash implementation
shared by ``review-gate`` and ``action/lib/combine_verdicts.sh`` (see DESIGN.md's "Combined PR
comment" section) — to Python. Byte-identical OUTPUT to the bash renderer for identical inputs
was the bar the Slice-2 charter set for this module. A hand-synced inline copy used to live in
the vendored ``action/review.yml`` as a separate, pre-existing surface this port never touched;
issue #36 deleted that copy, leaving this module and ``action/lib/combine_verdicts.sh`` as the
only two.

Two public entry points, mirroring the bash file's contract exactly:

  overall_color(colors)                         -> "green" | "yellow" | "red" | "unverified"
  render_comment(head_sha, agents, agent_data)   -> the full comment markdown, as one string

``agent_data`` is a mapping of agent name -> :class:`AgentRenderData`, replacing the bash
contract's per-agent env-var convention (``<NAME>_COLOR``, ``<NAME>_VERDICT``, ``<NAME>_TOP``,
``<NAME>_FINDINGS``, ``<NAME>_INVARIANT``, ``<NAME>_REASON``) with an explicit structure — Python
has no need for bash's ``${!var}`` indirection trick. :func:`render_from_env` reconstructs that
same env-var contract for callers (and the migration-exam harness, and eventually ``pantheon.cli``)
that still want to drive this module the way the bash version is driven today.

Sanitize-at-render (the two-layer contract DESIGN.md's "Validation surface" section describes):
every value this module reads out of an agent's JSON, or derives from one, is untrusted model
output — verdict, summary, and each finding's severity/file/line/issue/scenario — and is routed
through :func:`sanitize_inline` (or a stricter variant, e.g. the line-number-or-"?" coercion in
:func:`_finding_line_or_placeholder`) before it reaches the human-readable section of the
comment. The one deliberate exception is the machine tail (the nested "Raw verdict JSON" block
near the end of :func:`render_comment`) — it skips ``sanitize_inline``'s markdown-escaping steps
and prints the JSON as-is otherwise, because that's the whole point of keeping a machine-readable
copy. It is NOT exempt from :func:`redact_paths` itself, though (see that function's own
docstring) — repo-path AND credential redaction apply to the machine tail exactly as they do to
the human-readable sections, via :func:`_machine_tail_text`'s own direct calls to it.

Every JSON parse and every JSON serialize in this module goes through ``pantheon.jqjson``, not
Python's own json module's parse/serialize entry points directly — see that module's own
docstring for why: this port found three straight
rounds of the same class of divergence (a non-standard JSON-extension token, a lone surrogate, a
pathologically long integer, an overflowing numeric literal) by patching one Python-specific
failure mode at a time, which never converges. ``pantheon.verdict`` routes through the same
boundary, so the two modules share exactly one place this judgment call lives.

Fixture suite: tests/test-render-comment.sh (bash-internal in its original form — sourced the
retired bash CLI's ``render_comment.sh`` directly, removed in #29). Its black-box Python
equivalent is tests/test-render-comment-python.sh, which drives this module the same way the
original suite drives the sourced bash functions: via ``python3 -m pantheon.render``.

      1. Every env var in :data:`_CREDENTIAL_ENV_KEYS` that is actually SET in this process's own

         covering).

    Literal-value first, shape-based second: a literal value that also happens to match the shape
    regex is already gone by the time the regex pass runs (idempotent — not a double-redaction

    performs its own ad hoc redaction. ``tests/test_render.py``'s

    that a sixth call site can't add its own bespoke logic instead of routing through here (the
    same enumeration-test pattern ``tests/test-json-boundary.sh`` uses for ``pantheon.jqjson``).

    Two, unconditionally-ordered, passes:

      1. :func:`_redact_credentials` — credential VALUES (an env-configured secret this process
         itself holds, e.g. the ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` a compromised reviewer run has every incentive to
         exfiltrate through the very comment it's rendering) and credential-SHAPED tokens (a
         GitHub/Anthropic token whose value this process's own env never held at all). Runs FIRST,
         and unconditionally — before the ``repo_root`` falsy-check below, and regardless of its
         outcome — because a credential leak has nothing to do with whether path redaction happens
         to be configured for this call; a local ``pantheon gate`` run with no ``repo_root`` passed
         must still never publish a credential it can see.
      2. Path redaction (the original responsibility this function name describes) — replaces
         every occurrence of ``repo_root`` (an absolute filesystem path) — AND every other
         spelling that identifies the same user/location — with the stable placeholder ``<repo>``.
         A no-op when ``repo_root`` is falsy.

    Order between the two passes can't re-expose or corrupt either one's output: a credential
    value/shape and a filesystem path are disjoint text shapes (a token never looks like a path
    and vice versa), and each pass's own replacement placeholder (``<redacted-credential>`` /
    ``<repo>``) contains no characters the OTHER pass's pattern could go on to match.

    Originally a fix for a real information-disclosure regression CRITICAL-1's own fix
    (adversarial review) introduced: that fix exposes the repo's absolute path to the reviewing
    agent (``pantheon.cli._build_prompt``'s "Repo root (absolute path...)" Run-context line —
    necessary so ``Read``/``Grep``/``Glob`` still work once the provider no longer launches with
    the repo checkout as its own cwd) so the model can now ECHO that absolute path back verbatim
    in a finding's ``file``/``issue``/``scenario``/``summary`` text — and that text gets POSTED to
    a PR comment. On CI runners that's a harmless ephemeral path, but a CLI-lane run from a
    maintainer's own machine has their REAL home directory path (often containing their username)
    published into what may be a public PR comment.

    **What this function covers, and why each was needed (five rounds, now consolidated):**

      - A **parent-path leak** — the model cites the bare home-directory prefix
        (``/Users/alice``) rather than the full repo path. Closed by
        :func:`_home_directory_redaction_targets`.
      - A **trailing-slash / symlink-resolved form** — ``repo_root``/home with or without a
        trailing separator, and each one's ``os.path.realpath`` — a provider CLI (or the OS path
        resolution it goes through) can hand back a textually different spelling of the identical
        directory (macOS's own ``/tmp`` -> ``/private/tmp`` is a standing example). Closed by
        :func:`_path_redaction_variants`.
      - A **case variant** — on a case-insensitive filesystem (macOS/Windows — see
        :func:`_case_insensitive_path_platform`), ``/Users/Alice/repo`` and ``/users/alice/repo``
        name the same directory; ``re.IGNORECASE`` applies on those platforms only (Linux paths
        ARE case-sensitive — redacting a same-spelled-but-different-case path there would be a
        false-positive over-redaction, not a fix).
      - **JSON-escaped spellings** — a target containing a JSON-escapable character (a legal
        ``"`` in a POSIX directory name, or a ``\\`` — Git Bash on Windows checks repos out under
        paths containing one) can appear in TEXT that already went through JSON serialization
        (:func:`_machine_tail_text`'s success path) OR text that was never OUR serialization at
        all but is still JSON-shaped bytes an agent produced (:func:`_machine_tail_text`'s
        raw-text FALLBACK, when the overall document fails to parse but individual string
        fragments inside it are still validly-escaped JSON — missed in an earlier round: that
        fallback only ever searched for the RAW, unescaped spelling). Both the raw and the
        JSON-escaped form of every target are searched for here, unconditionally, for every
        caller — one rule, not a per-call-site judgment call about which form THIS text happens
        to be in.
      - **Unanchored substring matching corrupting a sibling path** — redacting bare
        ``/home/alice`` as a substring would also match (and mangle) the unrelated
        ``/home/alice2/service``, which merely shares a prefix. Every alternative in the compiled
        pattern is followed by :data:`_PATH_BOUNDARY`, a lookahead requiring the match to end at
        a real path/token boundary (a ``/``, a non-path-component character, or end of string) —
        never mid-component.

    Every variant (raw and JSON-escaped) is escaped for regex (:func:`re.escape`) and combined
    into ONE pattern, alternatives ordered LONGEST-first (regex alternation takes the first
    alternative that matches at a given position, left to right — ordering longest-first is what
    makes "prefer the longer, more specific match" deterministic rather than a ``re`` module
    implementation detail; e.g. text containing the full ``repo_root`` must redact the WHOLE
    thing to ``<repo>``, not just its home-directory prefix, leaving the rest dangling
    unredacted next to a stray ``<repo>``), each followed by the shared boundary lookahead.

    Path redaction is a no-op when ``repo_root`` is falsy (the common case for every caller that
    hasn't opted into this — the two-runtime env-var bridge below, older callers); credential
    redaction is never gated on ``repo_root`` at all."""

        own escaped-spelling matching (not a separate step here) is what keeps THAT case covered
        too, without this function needing to know or care which shape the value arrived in.
      - ``repo_root`` (when given) redacted to ``<repo>`` — see :func:`redact_paths`. Done EARLY
        (right after stringification, before any of the markdown-escaping steps below) so the
        match is against the model's own literal text (modulo the JSON-escaping ``jq_text`` may
        already have applied for a non-string value, which :func:`redact_paths` itself accounts
        for), not a version already mangled by a LATER, unrelated escaping step below.
      - NUL (U+0000) dropped outright. Not a markdown/HTML concern like the rest of this
        function — it's a bash-parity one: bash's ``$(...)`` command substitution cannot hold a
        NUL byte and silently drops it (a documented bash limitation, not something the retired
        bash CLI's ``render_comment.sh`` (removed in #29) own code does explicitly), so a NUL smuggled into a
        display field via a JSON ``\\u0000`` escape survives Python's render but is silently gone
        from bash's — a real, verified byte-output divergence. Verified this is the ONLY C0
        control character bash's pipeline drops: a fixture with ``\\u0001``/``\\u0007``/``\\u001b``
        alongside a NUL showed every one of those three survive unchanged in bash's real output,
        only the NUL vanished — so this is scoped to NUL specifically, not C0 controls broadly.
        (Caught live — the repo's own self-hosted gate on this PR flagged this.)
      - Newlines collapsed to spaces (so a multi-line value can't fracture a table row/list item).
      - Pipes escaped (``\\|``), so a stray ``|`` can't fracture a markdown table row.
      - Backticks replaced with a straight quote — there is no backslash-escape for a backtick
        INSIDE a single-backtick-fenced code span in CommonMark.
      - Angle brackets HTML-escaped (``&lt;``/``&gt;``), so a value can't be mistaken for an HTML
        tag in GitHub's comment renderer.
      - ``@`` replaced with the fullwidth lookalike ＠ (U+FF20), so a model's text can't page an
        arbitrary user/team via a real GitHub notification.

    The machine tail (the nested "Raw verdict JSON" block, see this module's docstring) needs no
    equivalent NUL handling: a JSON serializer always escapes control characters — including NUL
    — as backslash-u-XXXX sequences regardless of ASCII-escaping mode, per the JSON spec, exactly
    like jq's own non-``-r`` pretty-printer does for the bash machine tail. A raw NUL byte only
    ever reaches bash's output via the ``-r`` (raw-string) mode this human-readable path uses;
    the machine tail was never at risk. The machine tail DOES still need the repo-root redaction
    above, though — it's not a markdown-safety concern the way NUL-handling is, it's the same
    information-disclosure concern reaching a second surface (the raw JSON is right below the
    human-readable table, in the same comment) — :func:`_machine_tail_text` calls
    :func:`redact_paths` directly on its own output (both the pretty-printed-JSON success path
    and the raw-text fallback), the same chokepoint this function calls, rather than going
    through this function itself.

    otherwise byte-identical-to-bash contract, same category as :func:`redact_paths`'s own
    repo-root redaction).

    :func:`redact_paths` runs on ``best`` HERE, before :func:`truncate` — not left to the
    caller's later ``sanitize_inline(_table_top_cell(...), repo_root)`` call to handle after the
    fact. ``truncate`` slices on a raw character count with no awareness of what it's cutting
    through: a credential landing across that cut point survives redaction two different ways —
    the literal-value pass no longer sees the value as one contiguous run to match, and the
    shape-regex pass's trailing-character floor (``{20,}``) can fail once the tail past the cut is
    gone. Left uncorrected, an attacker who controls the finding text controls the padding before
    a credential too, and can walk the truncation window across repeated runs to read the whole
    secret out in fragments. Redacting first means there is nothing contiguous left for
    ``truncate`` to split.

    Calling :func:`redact_paths` here does NOT double-redact anything: it is the module's one
    redaction PRIMITIVE (see its own docstring), not the full :func:`sanitize_inline` pipeline —
    it only ever replaces a matched credential/path with a fixed placeholder
    (``<redacted-credential>`` / ``<repo>``) that contains none of the characters either of its
    own two passes matches on, so a second pass over already-redacted text is a verified no-op,
    not a corruption risk (see ``tests/test_render.py``'s idempotence coverage). This is safe
    specifically BECAUSE it is ``redact_paths`` and not ``sanitize_inline`` — ``sanitize_inline``
    additionally does markdown/HTML escaping (``<`` -> ``&lt;`` et al.), which is NOT idempotent
    (a second pass over already-escaped text mangles it further, e.g. ``&lt;`` -> ``&amp;lt;``),
    so calling that a second time here instead would be wrong. The caller's own
    ``sanitize_inline(_table_top_cell(...), repo_root)`` call still runs afterward exactly once,

# the migration-exam harness can drive this module as a subprocess the same way
# tests/test-render-comment.sh's original bash-internal suite sourced the retired bash CLI's
# `render_comment.sh` (removed in #29) and called its two public functions directly.
#
#   python3 -m pantheon.render comment <head_sha> <agent...>   # prints the full comment

#
# The third subcommand isn't part of the bash file's two-entry-point public contract (truncate
# is an internal helper there, `_pantheon_truncate`) — it's exposed here purely so the migration-
# exam harness can exercise the character-safe-truncation boundary cases directly, the same way
# tests/test-render-comment.sh's Case 1/Case 2 fixtures call `_pantheon_truncate` in-process
# (this module has no in-process access from a bash test, so the CLI is the black-box seam).

# Both `comment`/`overall` read the per-agent env-var contract described in this module's
