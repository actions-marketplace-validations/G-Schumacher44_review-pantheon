"""action.yml's `mode: counsel` wiring (issue #95) — a structural companion to
tests/test-counsel-mode-fail-closed.sh (which drives action/lib/combine_verdicts.sh as a real
subprocess) and tests/test_workflow_shape.py (which guards the consumer-facing trigger/permissions
shape of examples/review-gate.yml and install.sh's Way A, neither of which this input touches).

This file asserts the properties a live GitHub Actions run can't be exercised for outside a real
runner: that the `mode` input defaults to "gate" (so every existing consumer is unaffected), that
gate mode's own enforcing step is the ONLY thing gated off in counsel mode, and that counsel mode
gets its own never-fails step instead — the fail-closed carve-out DESIGN.md's "counsel mode"
section states in prose, pinned here as parseable structure.
